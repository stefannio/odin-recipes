        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Bulgogi is a popular Korean BBQ dish made with thinly sliced pieces of beef marinated in a savory mixture of soy sauce, garlic, sesame oil, brown sugar, and other ingredients.</p>
        <p>It is traditionally cooked over a charcoal fire, although it can also be cooked in a pan. The thin slices of beef cook quickly, so there is no need to marinate it for long periods of time. </p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup (120ml) soy sauce </li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons (20ml) gochujang (spicy Korean red pepper paste) </li>
            <li>3 large cloves garlic, grated or minced </li>
            <li>1/2 Asian pear (or 1/2 red apple)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) honey </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) minced green onion </li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons (30ml) roasted sesame seeds </li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix all the marinade ingredients in a bowl and set aside. </li>
            <li>Thinly slice the beef and place it in the bowl with the marinade. Make sure the beef is completely covered in the sauce. </li>

            <li>Heat up a large skillet or grill pan over medium heat and add a tablespoon of oil. </li>
            <li>Add the marinated beef to the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until it is cooked through. </li>
            <li>Serve with steamed rice, kimchi, and other Korean side dishes. Enjoy!</li>
